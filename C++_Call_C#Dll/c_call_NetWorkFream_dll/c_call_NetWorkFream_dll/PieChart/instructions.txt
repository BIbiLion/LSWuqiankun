how to:
  1. the ManagedCode.h file should be included where you want to
     use PieChart3D or PieChartControl, because necessary headers and namespaces are included      or declared as using here;

  2. when use PieChartControl, the variable should be stated like this(see the 19th line in MFCDemoDlg.h):
     CWinFormsControl<System::Drawing::PieChart::PieChartControl> m_pieChartControl;
     as to other WinFormsControl, just substitute what's surrounded by '<' and '>';

     The following line shold be added to DoDataExchange(some comment is added to MFCDemoDlg.cpp)
     Microsoft::VisualC::MFC::DDX_ManagedControl(pDX, IDC_PLACEHOLDER, m_pieChartControl);
     the IDC_PLACEHOLDER is the ID for m_pieChartControl

  3. when pass data to PieChart3D, you should use classes defined in DataTypes.cs(for this demo).
     this is to solve type problems. And for now double value is used as decimal, it's ok
     if precision requirement is not that critical.

  4. you can see MFCTestDlg.h and MFCTestDlg.cpp for details

  5. set the project with /clr support

  6. Use of MFC should be set as "Use MFC in a Shared DLL"
